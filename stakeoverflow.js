//*/*/That way you give the user a chance to input numbers before you try to
// perform calculations on those numbers.

//(Note: I keep re-editing this because I'm having a lot of trouble
//deciphering the actual logic of what you're trying to do. The variable names
// don't help, since I don't speak that language. It's certainly possible that there
//are other problems here as well. But the main one is that you need to perform the
// calculations after the user types the values, not before.)

//Edit: I've further modified the code here after finding another
// significant issue. You were trying to access a .value property on h2 elements,
// which doesn't exist. You were also trying to store information in those elements
// as though they were variables.

//Instead,// just declare a variable to store the result of your
// calculation. Get the input (lonn), perform the calculation and get a result (result), write the output to the HTML elements (lonnUt and skattUt).
